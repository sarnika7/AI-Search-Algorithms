This repository contains the code which can be used to create and visualize the 12 searching algorithms

1.BMS(British Museum Search)

2.DFS(Depth First Search)

3.BFS(Bredth First Search)

4.Hill Climbing

5.Beam Search

6.Oracle

7.Branch and Bound

8.Branch and Bound with greed

9.Branch and Bound with greed with extended list

10.Branch and Bound with huersitics and cost

11.Branch and Bound with Greedy Huersitics

12.A*

The combination of all the algorithms and the implementation of these algorithms on user defined graph,tree can be found in Main File.py
